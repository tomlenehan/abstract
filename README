# Legislator Gala Coding Challenge

## Overview

This coding challenge consists of two files: SeatingChart.py and TestCases.py. The goal of this challenge is to create a seating chart for a given number of tables, guest list, and planner preferences.

## SeatingChart.py

### Description

The SeatingChart.py script contains a function named `create_seating_chart` which takes three required arguments and one optional argument:

- `num_tables`: an integer representing the number of tables.
- `guest_list`: a list of strings representing the list of guests.
- `planner_preferences`: an optional list of dictionaries representing the planner's preferences.
- `test_name`: an optional string representing the name of the output file.

The `create_seating_chart` function returns a JSON file with a seating chart dictionary where the keys are the table numbers and the values are lists of guests.

## TestCases.py

Run `TestCases.py` to generate a seating chart for each test case.
